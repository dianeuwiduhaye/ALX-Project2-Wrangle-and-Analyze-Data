# ALX-Project2-Wrangle-and-Analyze-Data
The dataset that I will be wrangling (and analyzing and visualizing) is the tweet archive of Twitter user @dog_rates, also known as WeRateDogs. WeRateDogs is a Twitter account that rates people's dogs with a humorous comment about the dog.
This Analysis contains the report and the Visualisation of the Analysed Data.
Yu are required to install Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib tu run the Notebook.
